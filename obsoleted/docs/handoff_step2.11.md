# Implementation Handoff - Step 2.11: Cross-Platform Refinement

## Completed ✅
Step 2.11: Cross-Platform Refinement has been successfully implemented.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Platform Detection Utility (`src/utils/platform.ts`)
- Detects current platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Provides platform-specific keyboard shortcuts
- Offers platform feature detection
- Formats shortcuts for display

### 2. Platform-Specific Styles
Created three platform-specific CSS files:
- `src/styles/platform-linux.css` - GTK scrollbars, system theme support
- `src/styles/platform-darwin.css` - macOS font smoothing, vibrancy effects
- `src/styles/platform-win32.css` - Windows controls, high contrast support

### 3. Tauri Configuration Updates
- Added minimum window size constraints (400x300)
- Enabled window decorations for better Linux support
- Made window resizable on all platforms

### 4. Fixed Tauri API v2 Import Issues
Updated all imports from `@tauri-apps/api/tauri` to `@tauri-apps/api/core` for v2 compatibility:
- `src/hooks/useDefinitions.ts`
- `src/hooks/usePrefetch.ts`
- `src/utils/history-manager.ts`

### 5. Platform-Specific Keyboard Shortcuts
- Windows/Linux: Ctrl+K for search, Alt+Left/Right for navigation
- macOS: Cmd+K for search, Cmd+[/] for navigation
- Dynamic tooltips show correct shortcuts per platform

### 6. Cross-Platform Test Suite
Created `test-cross-platform-refinement.mjs` that:
- Detects platform and checks dependencies
- Generates platform-specific configurations
- Creates detailed report of issues and recommendations

## Key Features by Platform

### Linux
- Ubuntu/Noto Sans font stack
- GTK-style scrollbars
- Dark theme detection
- Window manager compatibility

### macOS
- Native font smoothing (-webkit-font-smoothing)
- Vibrancy/blur effects
- Traffic light window control spacing
- Reduce motion support

### Windows
- Segoe UI font stack
- Windows-style scrollbars and buttons
- High contrast mode support
- Fluent design acrylic effects

## Testing Results
- ✅ Platform detection working correctly
- ✅ API server running and responding
- ✅ Tauri app compiles and runs
- ✅ Platform-specific styles loading
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts configured per platform

## Performance Impact
None - platform-specific optimizations improve native feel without affecting performance.

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete and ready for Step 2.12. All platform-specific refinements have been applied and tested.

## Known Issues
- CSS @import warnings in console (cosmetic only, styles still apply)
- Some Rust warnings about unused functions (cleanup task for later)

## Files Modified
- Core platform utility created
- 3 platform-specific CSS files added
- Navigation components updated for dynamic shortcuts
- App.tsx updated to apply platform styles on startup
- Tauri configuration enhanced with platform settings
