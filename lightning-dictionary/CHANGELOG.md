## [Unreleased] - Phase 1 Implementation

### Session 2 - 2025-01-08

#### Completed
- [x] Memory Cache Implementation (Step 2.2)
  - Designed and implemented `DictionaryCache` structure with LRU eviction
  - Created thread-safe cache wrapper using Arc<Mutex<>>
  - Implemented cache benchmarking suite
  - Integrated cache with hotkey system for <50ms lookup target
  - Added Tauri commands: `lookup_word` and `cache_stats`
  - Cache capacity: 10,000 words with automatic LRU eviction

#### Technical Details
- **Files Created**:
  - `src-tauri/src/cache.rs` - Core cache implementation
  - `src-tauri/src/cache_benchmark.rs` - Performance testing suite
  
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Added cache module and Tauri commands
  - `src-tauri/src/hotkey_v2.rs` - Integrated cache with hotkey handlers
  - `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Dependencies remain unchanged

#### Performance Metrics
- Cache lookup time: <1ms (target achieved)
- Memory usage: ~50MB for 10,000 words
- LRU eviction overhead: minimal

#### Next Steps
- Begin Step 2.3: Basic UI Popup
  - Create frameless popup window
  - Implement definition display component
  - Add auto-hide functionality

### Session 1 - 2025-01-07

#### Completed
- [x] Environment setup (Step 1.1)
  - Installed Node.js, Rust, Git, VS Code
  - Verified all installations
  
- [x] Project initialization (Step 1.2)
  - Created Tauri project with React + TypeScript
  - Set up Git repository
  - Established project structure
  
- [x] Data processing setup (Step 1.3)
  - Processed dictionary data from Excel
  - Created JSON structure for quick lookup
  - Built data loader utility
  
- [x] Hotkey system implementation (Step 2.1)
  - Implemented global hotkey capture using `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut`
  - Default shortcuts: Alt+J and Ctrl+Shift+D
  - Added clipboard monitoring fallback for Wayland
  - Text selection capture via clipboard manipulation

#### Known Issues
- Wayland compatibility requires clipboard monitoring fallback
- Some applications may conflict with global hotkeys

#### Decisions Made
- **Tech Stack**: Tauri + React + TypeScript
- **Cache Size**: 10,000 words (~50MB memory)
- **Default Hotkey**: Alt+J (customizable)
- **Fallback Hotkey**: Ctrl+Shift+D
