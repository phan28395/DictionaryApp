# Testing Hotkey System

## Test Instructions

1. **Application is now running!** You should see the Lightning Dictionary window.

2. **Test the hotkeys:**
   - Select any text in another application (browser, text editor, etc.)
   - Press `Alt+J` or `Ctrl+Shift+D`
   - The dictionary window should show and display the selected text

3. **Wayland Users:**
   - Since you're on Wayland (Fedora 42), global hotkeys might not work
   - Alternative: Copy any single word to clipboard
   - The clipboard monitor will detect it automatically

## What's Working:
- ✅ Hotkey registration (Alt+J and Ctrl+Shift+D)
- ✅ Event listeners in frontend
- ✅ Text selection capture with xdotool
- ✅ Wayland detection and fallback UI

## Next Steps:
- Connect to dictionary data (Step 2.2)
- Implement proper word lookup
- Add popup positioning near cursor
- Performance optimization

## Current Status:
- Step 2.1.1 ✅ Global hotkey capture implemented
- Step 2.1.2 ✅ Text selection capture implemented
- Step 2.1.3 ⏳ Ready for testing across applications
