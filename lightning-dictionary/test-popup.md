# Testing the Popup Dictionary - Phase 2.3

## Quick Test Guide

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### 2. Test the Popup (Linux Wayland)
Since hotkeys don't work on Wayland, the app monitors your clipboard:
- Copy any single word (e.g., select a word and press Ctrl+C)
- The popup should appear near your cursor
- The popup will show:
  - Word header
  - Part of speech (if available in cache)
  - Definitions (if available)
  - Performance metrics (lookup time)

### 3. Test the Popup (Other Systems)
- Select any text
- Press Alt+J or Ctrl+Shift+D
- The popup should appear

### 4. Close the Popup
- Press Escape key
- The popup window will close

## What's Implemented in Phase 2.3

✅ **2.3.1 Create popup window (React)**
- Frameless window design
- Position near cursor (with screen boundary detection)
- No auto-hide (as requested)

✅ **2.3.2 Definition display component**
- Word header with pronunciation
- Part of speech tags
- Definition list
- Clean, minimal design

✅ **2.3.3 Performance optimization**
- React.memo for preventing re-renders
- CSS animations (fade-in)
- Performance measurement built-in

## Performance Metrics
- The popup shows lookup time in milliseconds
- Target: <50ms for cached words
- The component measures render time in console

## Known Issues
- On Wayland, only clipboard monitoring works (not hotkeys)
- Cursor position detection requires xdotool on Linux
- Definitions only show if the word is in cache (no API yet)

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
- Implement REST API server
- Add dictionary data loading
- Implement fallback to API when cache misses
